## âœ… Why Do We Need Retrievers?
| Problem                                | Retriever Solution                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| LLMs are stateless (no memory of past) | Inject relevant context into prompts                   |
| Need up-to-date or private knowledge   | Retrieve from internal sources (PDFs, databases, APIs) |
| Reduce hallucination in LLM answers    | Ground LLM response with retrieved facts               |
